# Shade Slider

Playing around with shaders and Godot Engine.

## Android SDK Instructions
Download both Android SDK and NDK. You don't need Android Studio but it makes device management easier!
  1. Export the Android SDK and NDK PATH from Downloads folder:
    - `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/android-ndk-r15c`
    - `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/Android/Sdk/platform-tools`
    - `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Downloads/Android/Sdk/tools`

Try running `adb logcat`, and `adb devices` commands in terminal.
